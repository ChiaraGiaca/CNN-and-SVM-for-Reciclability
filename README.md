# Deep CNN and SVM Waste Classifier for Recyclability purposes

For this project I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) models together with a combination of both (CNN having as softmax layer a SVM) in order to predict in
which of the six recyclable categories (glass, garbage, plastic, paper, metal and cardboard) a particular object belongs to. 
I eventually evaluated such models and compared the result obtained.
